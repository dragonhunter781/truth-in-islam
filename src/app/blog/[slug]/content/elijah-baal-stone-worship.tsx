## Elijah Confronts Stone Worship: Implications for Islam

The prophet Elijah's (Ilyas in Arabic) ministry centered on opposing the worship of Baal and sacred stones. Yet Islam, which claims Elijah as a prophet, has retained similar practices. This paradox deserves examination.

### Elijah in the Quran

> "And indeed, Ilyas was from among the messengers. When he said to his people, 'Will you not fear Allah? Do you call upon Ba'l and leave the best of creators - Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?'"
> — [Quran 37:123-126](https://quran.com/37/123-126)

The Quran acknowledges that Elijah's mission was opposing Baal worship.

### The Biblical Account

**1 Kings 18: The Contest on Mount Carmel**

Elijah challenged 450 prophets of Baal to a contest:

> "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is god, follow him."
> — 1 Kings 18:21

**The test:** Build altars, prepare sacrifices, and call on your god to send fire.
- Baal's prophets prayed all day - nothing happened
- Elijah prayed briefly - fire fell from heaven, consuming the sacrifice

**Result:** The people declared, "The LORD—he is God!" (1 Kings 18:39)

### What Was Baal Worship?

**Baal** (בעל) was a Canaanite storm/fertility deity whose worship involved:

**1. Sacred Stones**
- Stone pillars called "masseboth"
- Kissing and touching sacred stones
- Circumambulating (walking around) stones
- Stone as center of worship

**2. High Places**
- Elevated worship sites
- Altars built on hills
- Sacred enclosures around stones

**3. Ritual Practices**
- Processions around sacred sites
- Animal sacrifices
- Repetitive prayers/chants
- Ascribing power to physical objects

**4. Connection to Moon Worship**
- Baal associated with celestial bodies
- Crescent moon symbolism
- Cyclical religious calendar

### The Etymology: Baal and Hubal

**Linguistic connection:**
- **Baal** (Phoenician/Canaanite) = "Lord/Master"
- **Hubal** (Arabic) = Likely derived from "Hu-Baal" (He is Baal)

**Hubal** was the chief deity at the Kaaba before Islam:
- Main idol inside the Kaaba
- Associated with moon worship
- Worshipped by Quraysh (Muhammad's tribe)
- Required circumambulation
- Central to pre-Islamic Arabian religion

### Striking Parallels

| Baal Worship | Islamic Practice |
|--------------|------------------|
| Sacred stone venerated | Black Stone kissed |
| Circumambulation around stones | Tawaf around Kaaba |
| Stone as focal point | Kaaba as qibla |
| Pilgrimages to stone sites | Hajj to Kaaba |
| Crescent moon symbol | Islamic crescent |
| High place worship | Kaaba on elevated site |

### Elijah's Message vs. Islamic Practice

**Elijah taught:**
- Don't worship at stone shrines
- Don't bow toward stones
- Don't make physical objects central to worship
- God is spirit, not localized in stones

**Islam practices:**
- Bowing toward a stone cube (Kaaba)
- Kissing/touching the Black Stone
- Circling a stone structure 7 times
- Physical object at center of worship

### Muhammad's Own Connection to the Kaaba

Before Islam, Muhammad's tribe (Quraysh) were:
- Guardians of the Kaaba
- Worshippers of Hubal and other deities
- Practitioners of stone-centered worship
- Economically dependent on Kaaba pilgrimage

**After Islam:**
- The Kaaba remained central
- The Black Stone remained venerated
- Circumambulation continued
- Pilgrimage practices retained

Muhammad didn't abolish these practices - he Islamized them.

### What Muslims Say

**Apologetic responses:**

1. **"We don't worship the stone, we worship Allah"**

Response: Elijah's contemporaries likely said the same about Baal worship. The physical practice of stone veneration is what Elijah opposed.

2. **"It's just the direction of prayer"**

Response: Why does prayer direction need a physical stone? Jesus taught:

> "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth."
> — John 4:24

3. **"Abraham built the Kaaba"**

Response:
- No historical/archaeological evidence
- Not mentioned in Genesis
- Abraham's locations were in Canaan, not Arabia
- First mention of Kaaba is 7th century AD

### The Irony

Islam claims Elijah as a Muslim prophet who opposed stone worship, yet:
- Makes a stone structure (Kaaba) the center of worship
- Requires facing it for every prayer
- Commands pilgrimages to kiss/touch it
- Mirrors the very practices Elijah opposed

### What the Bible Says About Sacred Stones

**God's command:**

> "Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the LORD your God."
> — Leviticus 26:1

**Prohibition is clear:**
- Don't make sacred stones
- Don't bow toward them
- Don't place them as objects of devotion

**God's nature:**

> "But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him."
> — John 4:23

True worship isn't tied to physical locations or objects.

### Historical Context

**Pre-Islamic Arabian religion:**
- Stone worship was widespread
- Each tribe had sacred stones
- The Kaaba housed 360 idols
- Hubal was supreme deity
- Economic system built on pilgrimage

**Muhammad's reform:**
- Removed the idols (except the stone structure itself)
- Declared monotheism
- Retained the pilgrimage system
- Kept the stone-centered rituals
- Continued economic benefits to Mecca

### The Christian Contrast

**Jesus taught:**

> "Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."
> — John 4:21-23

**Christianity:**
- No sacred stones
- No required pilgrimage sites
- No physical qibla
- Worship is spiritual, not locational
- Jesus is the focal point, not a building

### The Prophet's Consistency

Elijah's opposition to Baal worship was absolute:
- No compromise with stone veneration
- No "Monotheistic Baal worship"
- No retention of pilgrimage practices
- Complete break from physical-object-centered religion

If Elijah were alive today, what would he say about:
- Kissing a stone?
- Circling a cube 7 times?
- Praying toward a physical object?
- Making pilgrimage to a stone structure?

## Questions to Consider

1. Why does Islam retain practices similar to what Elijah opposed?
2. If Elijah condemned stone worship, why is the Black Stone central to Islam?
3. How is circling the Kaaba different from ancient Baal worship practices?
4. Why did Muhammad keep the Kaaba and its rituals when instituting monotheism?
5. What would Elijah say about Islamic pilgrimage practices?
