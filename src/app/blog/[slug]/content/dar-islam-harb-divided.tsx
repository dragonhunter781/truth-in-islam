## The Islamic Division of the World

Classical Islamic jurisprudence divides the world into distinct territories based on whether Islamic law (Sharia) is enforced. This division has profound implications for how Muslims are taught to view and interact with non-Muslim regions.

### The Two (or Three) Houses

**1. Dar al-Islam (دار الإسلام) - The House of Islam**
- Regions where Islamic law is enforced
- Muslims are in political control
- Non-Muslims live as dhimmis (second-class citizens)
- This is the ideal state according to Islamic law

**2. Dar al-Harb (دار الحرب) - The House of War**
- Regions not under Islamic rule
- Muslims do not control the government
- Islamic law is not enforced
- Literally means "House/Domain of War"

**3. Dar al-Ahd/Dar al-Sulh (دار العهد) - The House of Treaty**
- Some scholars include a third category
- Non-Muslim lands with treaties with Muslim states
- Temporary peace agreements
- Still technically part of Dar al-Harb, just not actively at war

### The Quranic Foundation

The concept stems from verses commanding Muslims to fight until Islam dominates:

> "And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah."
> — [Quran 8:39](https://quran.com/8/39)

> "Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors."
> — [Quran 2:193](https://quran.com/2/193)

**Fitnah** (فتنة) in this context means:
- Persecution of Muslims
- Resistance to Islamic rule
- The existence of non-Islamic governance

### Classical Islamic Scholarship

**Ibn Khaldun** (d. 1406) in his *Muqaddimah*:
> "In the Muslim community, holy war is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force."

**Reliance of the Traveller** (certified by Al-Azhar University), section o9.8:
> "The caliph makes war upon Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians... until they become Muslim or pay the non-Muslim poll tax."

Section o9.9 states:
> "The caliph fights all other peoples until they become Muslim."

**Al-Shafi'i** (d. 820), founder of one of the four major Sunni schools:
> "The least that the imam must do is that he allow no year to pass without having organized a military expedition by himself, or by his raiding parties, according to the Muslims' interest, so that the jihad will only be stopped in a year for a reasonable excuse."

### What This Means Practically

**In Dar al-Islam:**
- Muslims must live by Islamic law
- Non-Muslims are dhimmis with restricted rights
- Islamic courts enforce Sharia
- Apostasy from Islam is punishable by death
- The goal is complete Islamic governance

**In Dar al-Harb:**
- Classical scholars taught that Muslims should work to transform it into Dar al-Islam
- Some scholars permitted relaxing certain Islamic requirements (out of necessity)
- The relationship is theoretically one of conflict (even if temporarily peaceful)
- The ultimate goal is Islamic conquest or conversion

### The State of Perpetual Jihad

According to classical Islamic law, there is a permanent state of jihad between Dar al-Islam and Dar al-Harb:

**Majid Khadduri** (Islamic scholar) writes:
> "The jihad may be regarded as Islam's instrument for carrying out its ultimate objective by turning all people into believers... The universality of Islam, in its all-embracing creed, is imposed on the believers as a continuous process of warfare, psychological and political, if not strictly military."

**Ibn Taymiyyah** (d. 1328):
> "Since lawful warfare is essentially jihad and since its aim is that the religion is God's entirely and God's word is uppermost, therefore according to all Muslims, those who stand in the way of this aim must be fought."

### Can Peace Be Permanent?

Classical Islamic jurisprudence generally held that:
- Peace with non-Muslim states is temporary (treaties limited to 10 years max, following Muhammad's example at Hudaybiyyah)
- The ultimate goal is Islamic dominance globally
- Truces are strategic, not permanent solutions
- The obligation of jihad remains until the entire world is Muslim or submits to Islamic rule

**Abu Hanifa** (d. 767):
> "It is not permissible to have a truce with the enemy for more than ten years."

### Modern Adaptations

Contemporary Muslim scholars have attempted to reinterpret this doctrine:

**Modernist View:**
- Some argue that "Dar al-Harb" is outdated
- Suggest that Muslim-minority countries can be "Dar al-Da'wa" (House of Invitation/Mission)
- Emphasize peaceful coexistence

**Traditional View:**
- Classical divisions remain valid
- The obligation of jihad is permanent
- Peace is strategic and temporary
- Islamic scholars at Al-Azhar, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere still teach the traditional framework

### The Reality

Despite modernist reinterpretations, the traditional doctrine remains in:
- Classical Islamic legal texts still studied today
- Curricula in Islamic universities
- Sermons in conservative mosques
- Islamist movements' ideology
- ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and similar groups' justifications

### Biblical Comparison

Christianity teaches no such division of the world:

> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
> — John 3:16

Jesus commanded:
> "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."
> — Mark 16:15

The Great Commission is about persuasion and preaching, not conquest and forced submission. There is no "House of War" in Christian theology - only people who need to hear the Gospel.

> "Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
> — Ephesians 6:12

The Christian "warfare" is spiritual, not physical conquest of territories.

## Questions to Consider

1. Can a worldview that divides the world into "us" and "those we must fight" lead to lasting peace?
2. Why does Islamic law require perpetual conflict until Islam dominates?
3. How does the Dar al-Islam/Dar al-Harb division compare to Jesus' command to love your enemies?
4. What are the implications of teaching that non-Muslim lands are "houses of war"?
5. Is it possible to truly integrate into a society you're taught is Dar al-Harb?
