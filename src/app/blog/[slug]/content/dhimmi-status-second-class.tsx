## Understanding Dhimmi Status

The term "dhimmi" (ذمي) refers to non-Muslims living under Islamic rule who are granted protection in exchange for paying the jizya tax and accepting subordinate legal status. This system was codified in Islamic law and applied throughout Islamic history.

### The Quranic Foundation

> "Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled." (صَاغِرُونَ - saghirun)
> — [Quran 9:29](https://quran.com/9/29)

The Arabic word **saghirun** (صَاغِرُونَ) means "humbled," "subdued," or "belittled." This establishes the fundamental principle that non-Muslims must accept an inferior status.

### The Pact of Umar

The Pact of Umar (عهد عمر), attributed to Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, codifies the restrictions placed on dhimmis. According to this document, non-Muslims must agree to:

**Religious Restrictions:**
- Not build new churches, synagogues, or temples
- Not repair damaged places of worship without Muslim permission
- Not display crosses or religious books publicly
- Not ring church bells loudly
- Not hold public religious processions
- Not try to convert Muslims

**Social Restrictions:**
- Wear distinctive clothing to be identifiable (the ghiyar غيار)
- Not ride horses (only donkeys and mules)
- Stand up when Muslims want to sit
- Not take Muslim names
- Cut their hair in a distinctive style

**Legal Restrictions:**
- Not testify against Muslims in court
- Not build houses higher than Muslim houses
- Not carry weapons
- Pay the jizya tax in a humiliating ceremony

### How Jizya Was Collected

Classical Islamic sources describe the jizya payment ceremony as deliberately humiliating:

- The dhimmi would stand while the Muslim tax collector sat
- Payment was made with the hand extended palm-up (a sign of submission)
- Some sources describe the dhimmi receiving a blow or slap when paying
- The dhimmi would acknowledge his inferior status verbally

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir** on [Quran 9:29](https://quran.com/9/29) explains:
> "The jizya is taken from them with belittlement and humiliation. The dhimmi will come with his head bowed, while the Muslim who takes it from him will be in a superior position, grab him by the collar, and shake him saying 'Pay the jizya!'"

### Classical Scholarly Rulings

**Reliance of the Traveller** (a manual of Shafi'i Islamic jurisprudence certified by Al-Azhar University) states:

Section o11.5: "The jizya is paid at the beginning of each year and must be collected with belittlement and humiliation."

**Al-Mawardi** (d. 1058), in his legal treatise *Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah*, specifies:
- Dhimmis cannot hold authority over Muslims
- Their testimony against Muslims is not accepted
- They must dress distinctively to be recognized
- They are forbidden from public displays of their religion

### Historical Application

Throughout Islamic history, these rules were enforced with varying degrees of strictness:

**Ottoman Empire:**
- Non-Muslims paid higher taxes
- Wore distinctive colors (Jews wore yellow, Christians wore blue)
- Could not testify in court against Muslims
- Faced legal discrimination in inheritance and marriage laws

**Abbasid Caliphate:**
- Christians and Jews wore special badges or patches
- Restrictions on building heights
- Limitations on public religious expression
- Special dress codes enforced

**Umayyad Spain:**
- Despite being called a "golden age," dhimmis still paid jizya
- Faced periodic restrictions and persecutions
- Could not hold positions over Muslims
- Lived under constant threat of their status being revoked

### Modern Implications

While most Muslim-majority countries today do not formally implement dhimmi laws (due to Western influence and international pressure), the theological framework remains in Islamic law:

- Al-Azhar University in Egypt continues to certify texts containing these rulings
- Saudi Arabia forbids building churches
- Pakistan's blasphemy laws disproportionately target Christians
- Islamic scholars have not repudiated the classical dhimmi system

### The Biblical Contrast

Christianity teaches equality before God:

> "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
> — Galatians 3:28

Jesus commanded:
> "Love your neighbor as yourself."
> — Mark 12:31

The early church broke down ethnic and religious barriers, treating all people with equal dignity. The dhimmi system stands in stark contrast to these biblical principles.

## Questions to Consider

1. Can a system that legally mandates second-class status be called just?
2. Why do Islamic scholars continue to uphold these laws as valid?
3. How does dhimmi status compare to the biblical teaching that all people are made in God's image?
4. What does it say about a religion when it requires non-believers to be publicly humiliated?
