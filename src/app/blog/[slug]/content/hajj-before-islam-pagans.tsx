## Hajj Before Islam: What Pagans Did

The Islamic Hajj pilgrimage retains many pre-Islamic pagan rituals. Understanding what pagans did before Islam reveals the origins of these practices.

### Pre-Islamic Pilgrimage to Mecca

Before Islam, Arabian tribes made annual pilgrimages to Mecca for polytheistic worship. The rituals were well-established pagan practices.

### The Pagan Rituals

**1. Tawaf (Circumambulation)**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Walk around the Kaaba 7 times
- Often performed naked (men and women)
- Honor various deities housed in the Kaaba
- Counterclockwise direction

**Islamic version:**
- Same 7 circles
- Clothed (ihram garments)
- Now claimed to honor Allah
- Same direction

**The Quran acknowledges but doesn't explain why:**
> "Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the ancient House."
> — [Quran 22:29](https://quran.com/22/29)

**2. Sa'i (Running between Safa and Marwa)**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Run between two hills 7 times
- Connected to worship of Isaf and Na'ila (deified lovers turned to stone idols)
- These idols stood on the hills
- Pagan ritual for fertility

**Islamic version:**
- Same 7 runs
- Now reinterpreted as commemorating Hagar's search for water
- Same hills, same number
- Retained without scriptural basis in Genesis

**3. Kissing the Black Stone**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Stone venerated as sacred/divine
- Kissed by pilgrims for blessing
- Central to pagan worship
- Meteorite worship common in ancient world

**Islamic version:**
- Identical physical act
- New theological justification
- Still kissing the same stone pagans kissed

**4. Stoning the Pillars (Jamarat)**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Throwing stones at pillars
- Warding off evil spirits/jinn
- Pagan superstition
- Part of ancient Arabian religion

**Islamic version:**
- Same physical act
- Now called "stoning Satan"
- Same pillars, same stones
- Re-interpreted pagan ritual

**5. Animal Sacrifice**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Sacrificing animals to appease gods
- Blood offerings to deities
- Common pagan practice
- Part of polytheistic worship

**Islamic version:**
- Same practice
- Now in honor of Abraham
- Mass animal slaughter continues
- Re-purposed pagan ritual

**6. Shaving Heads**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Ritual purification practice
- Common in pagan religions
- Part of pilgrimage completion

**Islamic version:**
- Identical practice retained
- Given new Islamic meaning
- Same physical act

**7. Wearing Ihram**

**Pre-Islamic practice:**
- Special pilgrimage garments
- Often went naked for tawaf
- Ritual purity concept

**Islamic version:**
- Specific white garments
- Covers nakedness
- Same basic concept of ritual purity clothing

### What Muhammad Changed

**Things removed:**
- The 360 idols inside Kaaba
- Naked circumambulation
- Direct worship of multiple gods by name
- Explicit polytheism

**Things kept:**
- All the physical rituals
- The structure itself
- The Black Stone
- The pilgrimage system
- Economic benefits to Mecca
- Mecca's centrality

### The Numbers: Why 7?

**Seven appears constantly:**
- 7 circles around Kaaba
- 7 runs between hills
- 7 stones at each pillar
- 7 heavens in Islamic cosmology

**Why 7?**
- Ancient Near Eastern sacred number
- Babylonian influence (7 classical planets)
- Common in pagan numerology
- Not explained in Quran

### Historical Sources

**Ibn Ishaq** (earliest biography of Muhammad):
> "The Arabs... used to circumambulate the House naked... women as well as men."

**Al-Bukhari** records:
> "The people used to perform Tawaf of the Kaaba naked except the Hums [Quraysh and allied tribes] would perform it in their clothes."

### Early Muslim Doubts

**Umar ibn al-Khattab** questioned these practices:

**About Sa'i:**
> "What is this Sa'i (running) between Safa and Marwa? I do not see any reason for doing this."

**About the Black Stone:**
> "I know that you are a stone which can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen Allah's Messenger kiss you, I would not have kissed you."

**Notice:** Even Muhammad's closest companion doubted the logic of these practices.

### The Biblical Contrast

**When Israelites adopted pagan practices:**

> "They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtoreths."
> — Judges 2:13

Result: God's judgment and calls to repentance.

**What God commanded:**

> "You must demolish completely all the places where the nations you are dispossessing served their gods... Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones."
> — Deuteronomy 12:2-3

Complete destruction of pagan worship sites, not adaptation.

### Christian Pilgrimage

Early Christians didn't:
- Make pilgrimages to Jerusalem
- Retain pagan rituals
- Kiss sacred stones
- Circle buildings 7 times

Christian worship was spiritual:
> "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth."
> — John 4:24

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Islam retained pagan Arabian practices and gave them new meanings. The physical acts remained identical; only the theological justification changed.

**This raises questions:**
1. Can you make pagan rituals acceptable by changing their stated purpose?
2. Why would divine revelation retain practices God condemned in the Bible?
3. If these practices were wrong when done for Hubal, why are they right for Allah?

### What Historians Say

**Patricia Crone** (Islamic historian):
> "The Hajj rituals were clearly of pagan origin."

**Karen Armstrong** (religious historian):
> "The Hajj was a pagan pilgrimage that Muhammad allowed to continue."

Even sympathetic scholars acknowledge the pagan origins.

## Questions to Consider

1. Why did Muhammad keep rituals performed by idol worshippers?
2. If the practices were wrong when pagans did them, how did they become right?
3. Why the same numbers, locations, and actions as pagan rituals?
4. Can changing the stated purpose sanctify a pagan practice?
5. Why didn't Muhammad establish completely new, divinely-revealed practices?
