## Abraham's Sacrifice: Isaac or Ishmael?

The Quran and Bible disagree on which son Abraham was commanded to sacrifice. This isn't a minor detail - it reveals fundamental differences in how Islam and Christianity view God's covenant promises.

### The Biblical Account

> "Then God said, 'Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.'"
> — Genesis 22:2

**Clear details:**
- The son is **named**: Isaac
- Called Abraham's "only son" (Isaac was the son of promise)
- Location: Moriah (where Solomon later built the temple)
- Complete narrative preserved

### The Quranic Account

> "And he said, 'Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me. My Lord, grant me [a child] from among the righteous.' So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. And when he reached with him [the age of] exertion, he said, 'O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so see what you think.' He said, 'O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.'"
> — [Quran 37:99-102](https://quran.com/37/99-102)

**Notable omissions:**
- **No name given** for the son
- No specific location
- Less detail overall

### Who Does the Quran Mean?

**The Quran never explicitly names which son**, leading to centuries of Islamic scholarly debate:

**Arguments for Ishmael:**
- [Quran 37:112-113](https://quran.com/37/112-113) mentions Isaac AFTER the sacrifice narrative
- Islamic tradition favors Ishmael to elevate Arab lineage
- Places Islamic holy sites in Arabia (where Ishmael lived)

**Arguments for Isaac:**
- Early Islamic scholars said Isaac (following Jewish/Christian sources)
- [Quran 11:71](https://quran.com/11/71) calls Isaac the "promised son"
- Quran 37 calling him "forbearing" matches Isaac's character

### What Classical Scholars Said

**Ibn Kathir:**
> "There is a difference of opinion among the scholars regarding which son was to be sacrificed. Some say Isaac, others say Ishmael."

**Al-Tabari** recorded both views but noted:
> "The majority of the scholars of the Torah and the Gospel say it was Isaac."

**Modern Islamic consensus** tends toward Ishmael, though the Quran doesn't say.

### Why the Bible Says Isaac

**1. Called Abraham's "only son"**

Genesis 22:2 - "your only son" - Isaac was the only son of Sarah, the free wife, and the son of promise.

**2. The covenant was through Isaac**

> "But God said to him... 'It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.'"
> — Genesis 21:12

> "Then God said, 'Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.'"
> — Genesis 17:19

**3. The location proves it**

Genesis 22 says Moriah, where Abraham sacrificed Isaac. 2 Chronicles 3:1 identifies this as where Solomon built the temple - in Jerusalem, not Arabia.

**4. The son went willingly**

Isaac was old enough to understand and submit (likely a teenager). The account shows his willing participation. This prefigures Christ's willing sacrifice.

### The Theological Significance

**Why this matters:**

**1. The Covenant Line**

God's covenant promises went through Isaac, not Ishmael:
- The Messiah would come through Isaac's line
- The promised land was for Isaac's descendants
- Spiritual blessings flow through Isaac (Romans 9:7-8)

**2. Prefiguring Christ**

Isaac's near-sacrifice foreshadows Jesus:
- The father offering his only son
- The son carrying the wood (like Jesus carrying the cross)
- The son submitting willingly
- God providing the sacrifice (ram substituting, Christ completing)
- Location: Moriah/Jerusalem, where Jesus was crucified

> "Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
> — John 8:56 (Jesus speaking)

**3. Ishmael's Blessing was Different**

God blessed Ishmael:

> "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac."
> — Genesis 17:20-21

Ishmael received blessings, but the covenant went through Isaac.

### Why Islam Changed It

**Political/Religious Reasons:**

1. **Elevate Arab lineage** - Arabs trace ancestry to Ishmael
2. **Justify Kaaba** - Islamic tradition places Abraham and Ishmael in Mecca
3. **Supersession theology** - Islam as replacement for Judaism/Christianity
4. **Alternative narrative** - Creating distinctly Islamic sacred history

### Historical Problems for Islamic View

**1. No evidence of Abraham in Mecca**
- No archaeological evidence
- No historical records outside Islamic tradition
- Bible places Abraham in Canaan/Moriah, not Arabia

**2. Ishmael's biblical location**
- Settled in wilderness of Paran (Sinai peninsula)
- Not in Mecca/Arabia proper
- Married an Egyptian woman

**3. Timing issues**
- Isaac born when Abraham was 100
- Test came years later (Isaac was old enough to carry wood)
- Quran's vagueness creates confusion

### The Christian Understanding

Paul explains:

> "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise."
> — Galatians 4:22-23

**The allegory:**
- Ishmael represents works, slavery to law
- Isaac represents promise, freedom in Christ
- The covenant is through promise (Isaac), not flesh (Ishmael)

This is why which son matters - it's about faith vs. works, promise vs. flesh, Christ vs. law.

### The Ram Substitute

Genesis 22:13 - God provided a ram as substitute for Isaac.

**This points to Christ:**
- Isaac spared by God's provision
- Ram dies in his place
- Foreshadows Jesus as the Lamb of God
- "God will provide the lamb" - fulfilled in Christ

## Questions to Consider

1. Why doesn't the Quran name which son if it's supposed to be clear?
2. Why would Genesis lie about Isaac when all Jewish tradition confirms it?
3. How can the sacrifice story point to Christ if it was Ishmael?
4. Why does the Quran come 2,500 years after Genesis with a different story?
5. What evidence places Abraham in Mecca (as Islamic tradition claims)?
