## Muhammad's Medical Prescription: Camel Urine

One of the most bizarre and disturbing hadiths in Islamic literature records Muhammad prescribing camel urine as medicine. This authentic hadith raises serious questions about Muhammad's prophetic knowledge.

### The Hadith

> "A group of eight men from the tribe of 'Ukil came to the Prophet and then they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So, they said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Provide us with some milk.' Allah's Apostle said, 'I recommend that you should join the herd of camels.' So they went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) till they became healthy and fat."
> — [Sahih Bukhari 8:82:794](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5686)

**Another narration:**

> "The Prophet ordered them to go to the (herd of milk) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine)."
> — [Sahih Bukhari 7:71:590](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5685)

**And another:**

> "Some people from the tribe of 'Ukl came to the Prophet and embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine)."
> — [Sahih Bukhari 8:82:796](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5686)

### Multiple Sahih Hadith

This is not an isolated or weak hadith. It appears in:
- **Sahih Bukhari** (multiple times)
- **Sahih Muslim** 1671a
- **Sunan Abu Dawud** 4364
- **Sunan an-Nasa'i** 307
- **Sunan Ibn Majah** 3503

The consistency across multiple authentic hadith collections proves this is not a fabrication or mistranslation.

### The Medical Reality

**Modern Medicine:**
- Urine is a waste product containing toxins filtered by the kidneys
- Drinking urine, including camel urine, is not recommended by any legitimate medical authority
- Camel urine contains high concentrations of urea, creatinine, and other waste products
- It can transmit diseases, including MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)

**Health Risks:**
- Bacterial infections
- Viral infections (including MERS)
- Parasite transmission
- Kidney damage from toxin recirculation
- Dehydration
- Electrolyte imbalances

**WHO Warning (2015):**
The World Health Organization warned against drinking camel urine due to MERS outbreak:
> "WHO urges people at high risk of MERS-CoV infection to avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine."

### Islamic Response: Still Promoted

Despite medical evidence, some Muslims continue to promote camel urine:

**Modern Products:**
- Camel urine is sold in some Middle Eastern markets
- Some traditional medicine practitioners recommend it
- Islamic websites defend the practice

**Dr. Faten Khorshid** (Saudi researcher) claimed in 2011:
> "Camel urine contains potent anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties."

Her "research" was widely criticized by the scientific community for methodological flaws.

### Classical Islamic View

**Ibn al-Qayyim** (d. 1350), in *Medicine of the Prophet*:
> "The urine of camels is a medicine that is beneficial for those who have problems with their livers and stomachs."

**Ibn Sina (Avicenna)** mentioned camel urine in his medical texts, reflecting the medical ignorance of the time.

### The Theological Problem

Muslims claim Muhammad received revelation from Allah, the Creator of all things. Yet Muhammad prescribed:
- Drinking waste products
- A medically harmful practice
- Something that can transmit deadly diseases

If Muhammad was receiving divine knowledge, why didn't Allah correct this dangerous medical advice?

### Modern Apologetic Responses

**Argument 1: "It was specific to those people"**

Response:
- Muhammad presented it as medicine, not a one-time exception
- Classical scholars recommended it generally
- Modern Muslims still promote it
- If it was specific, why is it in hadith as an example to follow?

**Argument 2: "Science will eventually prove it works"**

Response:
- This is wishful thinking, not evidence
- Decades of research have found no benefits
- The disease risks are well-documented
- This argument could justify any harmful practice

**Argument 3: "It was effective for that specific illness"**

Response:
- The hadith says they had "unsuitable climate," not a specific disease
- No disease is cured by drinking urine
- This is post-hoc rationalization
- Where is the evidence?

**Argument 4: "Modern camel urine is different"**

Response:
- Urine composition hasn't changed
- This is biologically nonsensical
- It's still a waste product
- Modern camels and ancient camels have the same biology

### The Scientific Method

If camel urine were truly medicinal, we'd expect:
- Controlled studies showing efficacy
- Peer-reviewed research
- Medical adoption worldwide
- Understanding of mechanism of action

Instead we have:
- No quality research supporting it
- WHO warnings against it
- Disease transmission documented
- Continued harm to those who follow this advice

### The Biblical Contrast

The Bible contains no such medical advice. Jesus healed people through:
- Miraculous power
- Touch
- Word of command
- Faith

Never through bizarre or harmful "medicines." When Jesus used mud on eyes (John 9:6), it was clearly miraculous, not medical advice to be followed generally.

### The Full Story: Murder and Torture

The hadith continues with a disturbing sequel:

> "When they became healthy and fat, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the Prophet, he sent (men) in their pursuit and they were captured and brought to the Prophet. The Prophet gave orders that their hands and legs should be cut off and their eyes be branded with heated iron pieces, and they should be thrown at Al-Harra (stony land), and when they asked for water, no water should be given to them."
> — [Sahih Bukhari 8:82:796](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5686)

So not only did Muhammad prescribe camel urine, but when these men committed crimes, he ordered:
- Amputation of hands and feet
- Eyes branded with hot iron
- Left to die of thirst in the desert

This raises additional moral questions beyond the medical issue.

### Why This Matters

The camel urine hadith demonstrates:

1. **Medical ignorance** - Muhammad didn't know urine is harmful
2. **No divine knowledge** - Allah didn't correct this error
3. **Ongoing harm** - Muslims still follow this advice and get sick
4. **Apologetic failure** - Modern defenses are desperate and unscientific
5. **Character questions** - The full hadith reveals brutal punishment

## Questions to Consider

1. Why would a prophet of God prescribe drinking waste products?
2. If this hadith is authentic, what does it say about Muhammad's knowledge?
3. Why do some Muslims still promote this despite medical evidence?
4. How many people have gotten sick following this advice?
5. Can we trust spiritual guidance from someone with such poor judgment about basic health?
