## The Sun's Daily Journey to Allah's Throne

According to authentic hadith, the sun physically travels to prostrate beneath Allah's throne every night before returning to rise again. This belief reflects geocentric cosmology and contradicts our understanding of the solar system.

### The Hadith

> "Abu Dharr said: I was sitting behind the Apostle of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: 'Do you know where this (sun) goes?' I replied: 'Allah and His Apostle know best.' He said: 'It goes and prostrates beneath the Throne, then it asks permission (to rise) and permission is given to it. But soon it will prostrate and it will not be accepted from it, and it will ask permission (to rise) and permission will not be given to it; it will be said to it: "Go back where you came from." So it will rise from the west. That is the interpretation of the statement of Allah: "And the sun runs to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing."'"
> — [Sahih Bukhari 4:54:421](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3199)

**Another narration:**

> "The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know better.' He said, 'It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west.'"
> — [Sahih Bukhari 4:54:421](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3199)

### The Quranic Foundation

> "And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing."
> — [Quran 36:38](https://quran.com/36/38)

**Arabic:** وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا

**Key word:** *Tajri* (تَجْرِي) = "runs" or "travels"

### Classical Understanding

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir** on [Quran 36:38](https://quran.com/36/38):
> "The sun runs in its fixed course, as it appears to the people of Earth... It has been said that it runs to the Throne of Allah in the heaven, prostrating beneath it every night."

**Tafsir al-Tabari:**
> "The sun travels to its resting place beneath the Throne of Allah."

**Tafsir al-Qurtubi:**
> "It prostrates beneath the Throne every night and asks permission to rise again."

### The Scientific Reality

**1. The sun doesn't travel around Earth**
- Earth rotates on its axis, creating the illusion of the sun moving
- The sun is stationary relative to Earth (it orbits the galactic center, but not Earth)
- There is no daily journey the sun takes
- Sunset is simply Earth rotating away from the sun

**2. The sun doesn't prostrate**
- The sun is a ball of plasma undergoing nuclear fusion
- It has no consciousness or will
- It cannot bow, prostrate, or ask permission
- The concept anthropomorphizes an inanimate celestial body

**3. The sun doesn't disappear at night**
- When it's night where you are, it's day elsewhere on Earth
- The sun is always visible from somewhere on Earth
- It never goes "beneath" anything
- There's no throne for it to prostrate beneath

**4. The sun won't rise from the west**
- For this to happen, Earth would have to reverse its rotation
- This would require impossible amounts of energy
- It would destroy all life on Earth
- There's no mechanism for this to occur

### Pre-Islamic Arabian Beliefs

Pre-Islamic Arabs, like most ancient peoples, believed:
- The sun literally traveled across the sky
- It went somewhere at night
- The earth was stationary and flat
- Celestial bodies had consciousness/life

Muhammad's statements reflect these common beliefs rather than correcting them with divine knowledge.

### The Geocentric Problem

This hadith reveals a geocentric worldview:
- The sun is moving, not Earth
- The sun has a daily cycle of travel
- The sun prostrates beneath a throne located "above" Earth
- Direction (up/down) is absolute, not relative

This was the universal view until Copernicus (1543 CE) proposed heliocentrism, which was later confirmed by Galileo.

### Scholarly Responses

**Classical scholars** accepted this literally:
- Al-Ghazali wrote about it in his works
- Ibn Taymiyyah confirmed it
- No major classical scholar questioned it

**Modern scholars** face a dilemma:
- The hadith is sahih (authentic)
- It clearly contradicts science
- They must either reject sahih hadith or science

### Modern Apologetic Responses

**Argument 1: "It's metaphorical"**

Response:
- Muhammad presented it as literal fact
- Abu Dharr understood it literally
- Classical scholars unanimously took it literally
- If sahih hadith can be dismissed as metaphor, what remains authoritative?

**Argument 2: "The sun does move around the galaxy"**

Response:
- This is desperate retrofitting
- The hadith describes a daily cycle, not galactic orbit
- The sun doesn't prostrate beneath any throne in its galactic orbit
- The hadith explicitly connects this to sunset/sunrise cycle

**Argument 3: "We can't understand spiritual realities"**

Response:
- The hadith makes a physical claim about the sun's daily movement
- This isn't about spirituality; it's about astronomy
- Physical claims can be tested and verified
- This excuse could be used to defend any false statement

**Argument 4: "It's from the sun's perspective"**

Response:
- The sun has no perspective; it's not conscious
- The hadith describes physical movement and prostration
- This doesn't explain the astronomical errors
- Classical scholars never suggested this interpretation

### Related Quranic Verses

> "And He it is Who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each in an orbit floating."
> — [Quran 21:33](https://quran.com/21/33)

Some Muslims claim this refers to heliocentrism, but in context with the hadith, it clearly describes geocentric movement.

> "And the sun and the moon are joined together."
> — [Quran 75:9](https://quran.com/75/9)

This describes a future event where the sun and moon will be joined - another cosmological impossibility.

### The Biblical Comparison

The Bible uses phenomenological language:

> "The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises."
> — Ecclesiastes 1:5

This describes appearance from Earth's perspective without claiming the sun literally travels. It's poetic language in Wisdom literature.

The Bible never claims the sun prostrates beneath God's throne or provides false astronomical explanations.

When Joshua asked God to stop the sun:

> "Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon. So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies."
> — Joshua 10:12-13

This is clearly miraculous intervention, not a scientific description. The text uses the perspective of the observer, which is how we still speak today ("sunset," "sunrise").

### Why This Matters

This error demonstrates:

1. **Geocentric worldview** - Muhammad believed the sun literally moves around Earth
2. **No divine correction** - If receiving revelation from the Creator, why perpetuate this error?
3. **Anthropomorphism** - Attributing human actions (prostration) to the sun
4. **Apocalyptic claims** - The sun will someday rise from the west (impossible)
5. **Hadith reliability** - If sahih hadith contain errors, how can we trust any of them?

## Questions to Consider

1. Can a prophet of God be wrong about basic astronomy?
2. Why would Muhammad teach that the sun prostrates beneath Allah's throne?
3. If this hadith is authentic (sahih), what does its scientific error mean for Islam?
4. How can modern Muslims reinterpret what was clear to classical scholars?
5. What does this reveal about the source of Muhammad's information?
