## Pre-Islamic Arabia: Paganism at the Kaaba

Before Islam, the Kaaba was the center of Arabian polytheistic worship. Understanding its pagan origins raises important questions about Islamic practices.

### The Pre-Islamic Kaaba

**Historical Facts:**

1. **360 Idols Inside**
- Each Arabian tribe had its idol
- Hubal was the chief deity
- Various gods and goddesses represented
- The structure was a pagan temple

2. **Hubal - The Chief God**
- Moon deity
- Supreme god of Mecca
- Made of red carnelian
- Stood inside the Kaaba
- Allah may be derived from "Al-ilah" (the god), a title for Hubal

3. **The Three Daughters of Allah**
- Al-Lat (اللات) - The Goddess
- Al-Uzza (العزى) - The Mighty One
- Manat (مناة) - Fate/Destiny

These were worshipped alongside the chief deity.

### Quranic Acknowledgment

The Quran mentions these goddesses:

> "So have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza? And Manat, the third - the other one? Is the male for you and for Him the female? That, then, is an unjust division."
> — [Quran 53:19-22](https://quran.com/53/19-22)

### Pre-Islamic Pilgrimage Rituals

**Practices before Islam:**

1. **Tawaf (Circumambulation)**
- Walking around the Kaaba 7 times
- Pre-Islamic Arabs did this for their gods
- Often done naked
- Pagan ritual adopted by Islam

2. **Kissing the Black Stone**
- Stone veneration predates Islam
- Considered sacred by pagans
- Muhammad retained this practice
- Pagan origins undeniable

3. **Sa'i (Running between Safa and Marwa)**
- Running between two hills 7 times
- Connected to worship of Isaf and Na'ila (idols)
- Islamic tradition reinterprets as Hagar's story
- Pagan practice retained

4. **Throwing Stones at Pillars**
- Representing driving away evil spirits
- Pre-Islamic superstition
- Continued in Islam as "stoning the devil"

5. **Animal Sacrifice**
- Common pagan practice
- Done to appease gods
- Continued in Islamic Eid al-Adha

### What Muhammad Did

When Muhammad conquered Mecca (630 AD), he:

**Destroyed:**
- The 360 idols inside the Kaaba
- Statues of specific deities
- Direct worship of multiple gods

**Retained:**
- The Kaaba structure itself
- The Black Stone
- Circumambulation ritual
- Pilgrimage system
- Stone throwing
- Sa'i between hills
- Animal sacrifice
- Economic benefit to Mecca

### The Question of Continuity

**Why keep pagan practices?**

1. **Political pragmatism** - Appeasing Meccans
2. **Economic reasons** - Pilgrimage brought wealth
3. **Cultural inertia** - Easier to Islamize than abolish
4. **Muhammad's tribe** - Quraysh were Kaaba guardians

### Comparison: Biblical Approach

When Israel encountered Canaanite worship sites:

> "Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles."
> — Exodus 34:13

Complete destruction of pagan worship infrastructure was commanded. No "monotheistic adaptation" of pagan sites.

**Jesus in the Temple:**

> "Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves."
> — Matthew 21:12

Jesus cleansed even the Hebrew temple when it was corrupted. He didn't adapt pagan practices.

### The Satanic Verses Incident

Early Islamic sources record that Muhammad initially approved verses praising the three goddesses:

> "These are the exalted cranes (intermediaries) whose intercession is to be hoped for."

Later, he claimed Satan had deceived him and these verses were abrogated. This incident (recorded in Ibn Ishaq, al-Tabari) shows the pressure to accommodate paganism.

### Archaeological Evidence

No evidence supports:
- Abraham building the Kaaba
- Pre-Islamic monotheism in Mecca
- The Kaaba being anything but a pagan temple before Islam

Archaeological findings show:
- Mecca was a pagan worship center
- Multiple deities worshipped
- Typical Arabian polytheistic practices
- No connection to Abraham

### What Muslims Say

**Apologetic responses:**

1. **"Abraham built the Kaaba originally"**

Response: No historical evidence. First mention is 7th century AD.

2. **"We purified pagan practices"**

Response: Purifying pagan rituals doesn't make them divinely ordained.

3. **"The practices have different meanings now"**

Response: Changing the stated reason doesn't change the pagan origin.

### Umar's Doubt

Even Umar ibn al-Khattab (second caliph) questioned the Black Stone:

> "I know that you are a stone that can neither harm nor benefit. Were it not that I had seen the Messenger of Allah kiss you, I would not have kissed you."
> — Sahih Bukhari 2:26:667

If a close companion of Muhammad expressed doubt about stone worship, shouldn't we?

## Questions to Consider

1. Why did Muhammad retain pagan rituals if they were wrong?
2. Can changing the stated purpose of a ritual change its essential nature?
3. Why is there no evidence for Abraham at the Kaaba?
4. If the Kaaba housed 360 idols, why keep the structure?
5. Why does Islamic practice mirror pre-Islamic paganism so closely?
