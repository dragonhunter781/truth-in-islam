## The Story of Dhul-Qarnayn

The Quran tells the story of Dhul-Qarnayn (ذو القرنين), traditionally identified as Alexander the Great, who traveled to the ends of the earth. What he discovered there raises serious questions about the Quran's scientific accuracy.

### The Quranic Text

> "Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people."
> — [Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/18/86)

**Arabic text:** حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ

**Key words:**
- **Maghriba al-shams** (مَغْرِبَ الشَّمْسِ) = "the setting place of the sun"
- **Wajadaha** (وَجَدَهَا) = "he found it"
- **Taghrubu** (تَغْرُبُ) = "setting"
- **Fi 'aynin hami'ah** (فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ) = "in a spring of dark/murky water"

### What Classical Scholars Said

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir:**
> "The sun sets in a spring that contains mud. Some said it was a hot spring... It is also said that it sets in the ocean, which is the great, salty ocean that surrounds the earth from all sides."

**Tafsir al-Tabari** (d. 923), one of the most authoritative early commentaries:
> "The meaning of the Almighty's saying, 'He found it setting in a muddy spring' is as follows: When the sun sets, it sets in a muddy spring."

Al-Tabari then records various scholarly opinions:
> "Abu Hurayrah said: 'I was sitting with the Prophet and Abu Bakr and Umar when the Prophet said, "The sun has set." He asked, "Do you know where it goes?" They said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He said, "It goes until it prostrates beneath the Throne..."'"

**Tafsir al-Qurtubi** (d. 1273):
> "As for the idea that the sun sets in a muddy spring, this is what the verse appears to say literally."

**Tafsir al-Jalalayn:**
> "He found it [as if] setting in a muddy spring."

### The Scientific Problem

Modern science has established beyond any doubt:

1. **The sun doesn't "set" anywhere** - Earth rotates, creating the illusion of sunset
2. **The sun is 109 times wider than Earth** - It cannot fit into any spring
3. **The sun is 93 million miles away** - No one can travel to its "setting place"
4. **The sun is gaseous plasma at 10,000°F surface temperature** - It cannot touch water
5. **There is no "edge" where the sun sets** - Earth is spherical with no edge

### Modern Apologetic Responses

Contemporary Muslims offer several defenses:

**Argument 1: "It's from Dhul-Qarnayn's perspective"**

Response: The text says he "found it" (wajadaha) setting in the spring. If this is merely describing his visual perception, why use the word "found"? The verse presents this as an actual discovery, not an optical illusion.

Additionally, [Quran 18:90](https://quran.com/18/90) says:
> "Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against it any shield."

If the Quran is describing visual perception, why would people at sunrise need "no shield" against the sun? This suggests a literal understanding that they were dangerously close to the sun's rising point.

**Argument 2: "The word means 'appeared to set'"**

Response: The Arabic word **wajada** (وَجَدَ) means "he found" or "he discovered," not "it appeared to him." Classical Arabic scholars understood this as a literal finding, not mere appearance.

**Argument 3: "It's poetic/metaphorical language"**

Response:
- Classical tafsir scholars took it literally
- The Quran claims to be clear (مبين - mubin) in [Quran 12:1](https://quran.com/12/1)
- If this is metaphor, how do we know which verses are literal?
- Why would Allah use "metaphors" that contradict reality?

### The Pre-Islamic Context

This story was not original to Islam. The Syriac *Alexander Legend* (c. 630 CE) contains a similar account:

> "He went forth to the west and the sun set behind him... And he went on to see where the sun rises and where it sets."

The legend reflects ancient cosmology where people believed you could literally travel to where the sun sets. Muhammad appears to have borrowed this story without recognizing its scientific errors.

### Additional Context from Hadith

The hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari records:

> "The Prophet asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at the time of sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know better.' He said, 'It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west.'"
> — [Sahih Bukhari 4:54:421](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3199)

This hadith reinforces the understanding that Muhammad believed the sun physically travels to a specific location beneath Allah's throne.

### The Biblical Contrast

The Bible uses phenomenological language (describing appearances) but doesn't make scientifically false claims:

> "The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises."
> — Ecclesiastes 1:5

This describes what we observe from Earth's perspective without claiming the sun literally travels to a specific setting place or enters water.

Additionally, the Bible describes the earth as being suspended on nothing:
> "He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing."
> — Job 26:7

This remarkably aligns with modern understanding that Earth is suspended in space.

## Questions to Consider

1. If the Quran is from an all-knowing God, why does it contain pre-scientific cosmology?
2. Why did classical Islamic scholars unanimously interpret this verse literally?
3. Can we trust a book that describes the sun setting in a muddy spring?
4. Why do modern Muslims reinterpret verses their predecessors took literally?
5. If this is metaphorical, how do we distinguish Quranic metaphors from literal statements?
