## The Quranic Description of Human Reproduction

The Quran makes specific claims about where semen originates in the human body. These claims directly contradict established medical science and reveal the author's limited understanding of human anatomy.

### The Quranic Text

> "So let man observe from what he was created. He was created from a fluid, ejected, emerging from between the backbone and the ribs."
> — [Quran 86:5-7](https://quran.com/86/5-7)

**Arabic text:**
- فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ
- خُلِقَ مِن مَّاءٍ دَافِقٍ
- يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ

**Key words:**
- **Ma'in dafiq** (مَّاءٍ دَافِقٍ) = "gushing/ejected fluid"
- **Al-sulb** (الصُّلْبِ) = "backbone/loins"
- **Al-tara'ib** (التَّرَائِبِ) = "ribs/chest"
- **Min bayni** (مِن بَيْنِ) = "from between"

### What Classical Scholars Said

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir:**
> "Meaning the backbone (of the man) and the ribs (of the woman)... Al-Awfi narrated from Ibn Abbas that Al-Sulb refers to the man's backbone and At-Tara'ib refers to the woman's chest between her breasts."

**Tafsir al-Jalalayn:**
> "From between the loins, of the man, and the breast-bones, of the woman."

**Tafsir al-Tabari:**
> "It comes out from between the man's backbone and the woman's ribs."

**Tafsir al-Qurtubi:**
> "The fluid comes from the man's backbone and the woman's chest."

### The Scientific Reality

Modern medicine has established with absolute certainty:

**1. Sperm Production in Men:**
- Sperm is produced in the **testicles** (not the backbone)
- The testicles are located in the scrotum, far from the backbone
- Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes
- The process is completely unrelated to the spinal column

**2. Egg Production in Women:**
- Eggs are produced in the **ovaries** (not the ribs/chest)
- The ovaries are located in the lower abdomen/pelvis
- Oogenesis occurs in the ovarian follicles
- The process has no connection to the chest or ribs

**3. The Reproductive System:**
- Male: Testes → Epididymis → Vas Deferens → Prostate → Urethra
- Female: Ovaries → Fallopian Tubes → Uterus
- Neither system involves the backbone or chest area

### Classical Scientific Understanding

The error in Quran 86:5-7 reflects ancient Greek medical theory, particularly from **Hippocrates** (460-370 BCE) and **Galen** (129-200 CE):

**Hippocratic Theory:**
Ancient Greeks believed semen originated from the brain, traveled down the spinal cord, and was stored in the kidneys/loins region. This is why they called it "seed from the brain."

**Galenic Theory:**
Galen taught that semen was created from blood that was refined in the kidneys and loins area, which explained why men felt weakness in their backs after ejaculation.

This theory was widely accepted in the ancient world, including 7th-century Arabia. The Quran simply reflects this erroneous understanding rather than providing divine correction.

### Why Ancient People Believed This

Several observations led to this false conclusion:

1. **Lower back pain** after sexual activity (due to muscle exertion)
2. **Kidneys/loins area** associated with procreation in ancient cultures
3. **Lack of microscopes** to observe actual sperm production
4. **Influence of Greek medicine** on the ancient Near East

### Additional Quranic Verses

The Quran elsewhere describes semen as:

> "He was created from a fluid gushing forth."
> — [Quran 86:6](https://quran.com/86/6)

> "Has there not been over Man a period of time, when he was nothing to be mentioned? Verily, We created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (discharge of man and woman)."
> — [Quran 76:1-2](https://quran.com/76/1-2)

> "Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood)..."
> — [Quran 23:14](https://quran.com/23/14)

While these verses have other issues, Quran 86:7 specifically and uniquely makes the false claim about the backbone and ribs.

### Modern Apologetic Responses

**Argument 1: "Al-sulb means 'loins' not 'backbone'"**

Response:
- The word *sulb* (صُلْب) literally means "backbone" or "spine" in classical Arabic
- Classical tafsir unanimously translated it as "backbone"
- Even if "loins" is meant, this still doesn't help - sperm isn't produced in the loins either
- The testicles are in the scrotum, which is external and below the "loins"

**Argument 2: "It refers to the nerve pathways"**

Response:
- This is a desperate modern reinterpretation
- Classical scholars never mentioned nerves
- Nerves don't produce sperm
- The text says the fluid "emerges from between" these areas, not that nerves control reproduction

**Argument 3: "It's the location during embryonic development"**

Response:
- During fetal development, the gonads do form near the kidneys before descending
- However, the Quran is describing where semen **comes from** in adults, not embryology
- The verse says "he was created from a fluid, ejected" - clearly referring to ejaculation
- This apologetic wasn't proposed by any classical scholar

**Argument 4: "Al-tara'ib means the entire torso"**

Response:
- Classical Arabic lexicons define *tara'ib* as "ribs" or "chest"
- All major classical tafasir interpreted it as chest/ribs
- Modern attempts to redefine it are not based on classical usage
- If Allah meant "torso," Arabic has words for that

### The Biblical Comparison

The Bible uses phenomenological language about reproduction but doesn't make false anatomical claims:

> "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb."
> — Psalm 139:13

This poetic language describes God's creative power without making false claims about sperm originating from the backbone.

The Bible also uses "loins" idiomatically to refer to offspring:

> "Kings will come from your own loins."
> — 2 Chronicles 6:9

But this is clearly figurative language in poetry and prophecy, not claiming it's where sperm is literally produced. The Bible never presents a false scientific model as factual.

### Why This Matters

This error demonstrates:

1. **Human authorship** - The text reflects 7th-century medical ignorance
2. **Greek influence** - Muhammad likely learned this from Greek medical theory circulating in Arabia
3. **No divine knowledge** - An all-knowing God would not make this error
4. **Trust problems** - If the Quran is wrong about basic anatomy, what else is it wrong about?

The Quran claims to be from Allah, who created humans. Why would the Creator make an error about how His own creation works?

> "Will they not then ponder on the Quran? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity."
> — [Quran 4:82](https://quran.com/4/82)

The irony is that this very verse invites readers to examine the Quran for errors - and anatomical errors like this one are exactly what we find.

## Questions to Consider

1. Can a book from the Creator of humans contain errors about human anatomy?
2. Why does the Quran reflect ancient Greek medical theory rather than correct information?
3. Why did no classical Islamic scholar notice this was wrong?
4. If modern Muslims must reinterpret this verse, doesn't that prove classical understanding was incorrect?
5. How many other Quranic verses will need to be "reinterpreted" as science advances?
