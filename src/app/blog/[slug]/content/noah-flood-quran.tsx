## Noah's Flood in the Quran: Differences from the Bible

The Quran tells the story of Noah (Nuh) and the flood, but with significant differences from the Genesis account that raise questions about its accuracy.

### The Quranic Account

[Quran 11:25-49](https://quran.com/11/25-49) tells Noah's story with key differences:

**1. Noah's Son Drowned**

> "And Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], 'O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers.' But he said, 'I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.' [Noah] said, 'There is no protector today from the decree of Allah, except for whom He gives mercy.' And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned."
> — [Quran 11:42-43](https://quran.com/11/42-43)

**Bible:** All of Noah's sons were saved (Genesis 7:13).

**2. Noah's Wife Was Unfaithful**

> "Allah presents an example of those who disbelieved: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants but betrayed them..."
> — [Quran 66:10](https://quran.com/66/10)

**Bible:** No mention of Noah's wife being unfaithful. She was saved with Noah (Genesis 7:7).

**3. The Flood Was Local**

The Quran suggests a more regional flood, while Genesis describes a global catastrophe covering all mountains.

### Historical Problems

Muhammad may have confused Noah's story with:
- Greek flood myths
- Local flooding traditions
- Embellished rabbinic legends

### Why This Matters

If the Quran gets basic details wrong about Noah—whose sons were saved, whether his wife was faithful—can we trust it as divine revelation?

## Questions to Consider

1. Why does the Quran contradict Genesis about Noah's sons?
2. Why add details (unfaithful wife) not in the original account?
3. Which is more reliable: Genesis written closer to the events, or the Quran 3,000+ years later?
