## What is the Jizya?

Jizya (جزية) is a poll tax that non-Muslims must pay to Islamic rulers in exchange for "protection" and the right to practice their religion. It is mandated by the Quran and has been implemented throughout Islamic history.

### The Quranic Command

> "Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled."
> — [Quran 9:29](https://quran.com/9/29)

The Arabic text reads: **حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُوا الْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ**

**Key phrase:** *'an yadin wa-hum saghirun* (عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ)
- **'an yadin** = "from the hand" or "by hand"
- **saghirun** = "humbled," "subdued," "in a state of submission and abasement"

### How Classical Scholars Interpreted This

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir** explains [Quran 9:29](https://quran.com/9/29):
> "The jizya is to be taken from them with belittlement and humiliation. Ibn Abbas said, 'The jizya is a tax on the infidel.' As-Suddi said, 'The jizya is a tax on those who do not embrace Islam.' The dhimmi is to pay while he is standing, and the one who takes it should sit, grab the dhimmi by the scruff of his neck, shake him and say, 'Pay the jizya!' and when he pays, he should be slapped on the nape of his neck."

**Al-Wahidi** (d. 1075) in his tafsir writes:
> "The jizya shall not be accepted from them except when they come in person, walking and not riding, and deliver it while standing. The Muslim who receives it sits, seizes the dhimmi by the throat, shakes him, and says, 'Pay the jizya,' in order to humiliate him."

**Tafsir al-Jalalayn** states:
> "The jizya is taken from them with belittlement and humiliation - it is exacted from them in a humiliating manner."

### The Purpose: Incentivizing Conversion

The jizya served multiple purposes according to Islamic scholars:

1. **Economic pressure** - Make non-Muslim life financially difficult
2. **Public humiliation** - Reinforce Muslim superiority
3. **Incentive to convert** - Make Islam the economically rational choice
4. **Punishment** - Penalize those who reject Islam

**Abu Yusuf** (d. 798), student of Abu Hanifa, wrote in *Kitab al-Kharaj*:
> "The jizya is imposed on non-Muslims in lieu of their being killed. It is a mark of their subjugation to the Islamic state."

### Historical Rates and Collection

The amount varied throughout history but was consistently burdensome:

**Early Islamic Period:**
- Rich: 48 dirhams per year
- Middle class: 24 dirhams
- Poor: 12 dirhams

For context, a dirham was a day's wage, so even the "poor" rate represented nearly two weeks of labor.

**The Collection Ceremony**

Historical sources describe humiliating collection procedures:

- The dhimmi would come to pay in person (no proxies)
- He would stand while the collector sat
- He would extend his hand palm-up (sign of submission)
- The collector might slap his hand or neck
- He would verbally acknowledge his inferior status
- He would leave immediately after paying

### Who Had to Pay?

Jizya applied to:
- All adult male non-Muslims (ahl al-dhimma)
- Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and sometimes others
- Even poor monks and priests

Exemptions were rare:
- Women and children (but their male relatives had to pay more)
- Extreme poverty (at the ruler's discretion)
- Those who converted to Islam

### Failure to Pay

If a dhimmi failed to pay jizya:
- He lost his "protected" status
- He could be enslaved
- His property could be confiscated
- He could be killed
- His family could be sold into slavery

**Hadith evidence:**

> "When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them."
> — [Sahih Muslim 19:4294](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

### Modern Application

Although most Muslim-majority nations don't currently enforce jizya (due to Western influence), the theological basis remains:

- ISIS reintroduced jizya in territories it controlled (2014-2019)
- Some Islamist groups demand it in conflict zones
- Islamic scholars have not repudiated the concept
- It remains valid Islamic law in Sharia texts taught today

**Recent Examples:**
- ISIS demanded jizya from Christians in Mosul, Iraq (2014)
- Taliban have imposed jizya-like taxes on non-Muslims in Afghanistan
- Boko Haram has demanded jizya from Christians in Nigeria

### The Biblical Contrast

The Bible teaches that leaders should protect all citizens equally and that taxes should not discriminate based on religion:

> "Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor."
> — Romans 13:7

Jesus didn't establish a two-tier legal system. He taught equal treatment and love for all people, regardless of their faith.

> "Love your neighbor as yourself."
> — Matthew 22:39

The Christian concept of taxation is based on civic duty, not religious identity or humiliation.

## Questions to Consider

1. Is it just to tax people differently based on their religion?
2. Why would Allah command that non-Muslims be humiliated when paying a tax?
3. How does jizya compare to the biblical principle of equal treatment?
4. What does it say about a religion when it incentivizes conversion through financial coercion?
5. If jizya is meant to be humiliating, what does that reveal about Islam's view of non-Muslims?
