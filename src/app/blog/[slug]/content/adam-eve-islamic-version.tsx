## Adam and Eve: The Islamic Version

Islam's account of Adam and Eve contains both similarities and significant differences from the biblical narrative.

### Key Quranic Elements

**1. Created from Clay**

> "And certainly did We create man from clay..."
> — [Quran 23:12](https://quran.com/23/12)

**2. Angels Prostrated to Adam**

> "And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers."
> — [Quran 2:34](https://quran.com/2/34)

This is a major addition not in Genesis. Angels worshipping Adam raises theological problems.

**3. Both Adam and Eve Ate the Fruit**

> "Then Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, 'Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.' And he swore [by Allah] to them, 'Indeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors.' So he made them fall, through deception."
> — [Quran 7:20-22](https://quran.com/7/20-22)

The Quran doesn't blame Eve more than Adam (unlike some interpretations of Genesis).

**4. Repentance Accepted**

> "Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."
> — [Quran 2:37](https://quran.com/2/37)

Islam teaches their repentance was immediately accepted, no lasting sin nature inherited.

### Major Theological Difference

**Islam: No Original Sin**

Muslims reject the doctrine of original sin. Adam's sin didn't corrupt human nature. Each person is born pure (fitrah).

**Christianity: Original Sin Inherited**

> "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned..."
> — Romans 5:12

All humans inherit Adam's sin nature and need redemption through Christ.

### Why It Matters

If there's no inherited sin:
- Why do we need a Savior?
- Why did Jesus need to die?
- What is salvation from?

Islam's rejection of original sin logically leads to rejecting Christ's atonement.

### The Biblical View

Adam's fall had cosmic consequences:
- Sin nature inherited
- Separation from God
- Death entered the world
- Need for a Redeemer

This is why Jesus is called the "second Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45) - He undoes what Adam did.

## Questions to Consider

1. Why do humans consistently sin if born pure?
2. If Adam's sin didn't affect us, why did Jesus need to die?
3. Does Islamic theology underestimate the problem of sin?
4. Why does the Quran add the angel prostration detail?
