## The Seven Heavens: Islamic Cosmology Examined

The Quran repeatedly mentions seven layered heavens stacked above the earth. This ancient cosmological model contradicts modern astronomy and reflects 7th-century beliefs.

### The Quranic Verses

> "It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth, the like of them. [His] command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge."
> — [Quran 65:12](https://quran.com/65/12)

> "Then He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."
> — [Quran 41:12](https://quran.com/41/12)

> "Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens in layers?"
> — [Quran 71:15](https://quran.com/71/15)

**Arabic:** سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا

**Key phrase:** *Sab'a samawatin tibaqan* (سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا) = "seven heavens in layers/tiers"

### Additional References

The seven heavens appear in at least 7 different surahs:
- [Quran 2:29](https://quran.com/2/29) - "created for you all that is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens"
- [Quran 23:86](https://quran.com/23/86) - "Say, 'Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?'"
- [Quran 67:3](https://quran.com/67/3) - "Who created the seven heavens in layers"
- [Quran 78:12](https://quran.com/78/12) - "And constructed above you seven strong [heavens]"

### The Hadith Details

Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) describes traveling through each heaven:

> "Then he ascended with me until we reached the first heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was said, 'Who is it?' He said, 'Gabriel.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said, 'Muhammad.' It was said, 'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.' Then the gate was opened..."
> — [Sahih Bukhari 5:58:227](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207)

The hadith describes Muhammad visiting each of the seven heavens, meeting different prophets in each:
- **First heaven:** Adam
- **Second heaven:** John (Yahya) and Jesus (Isa)
- **Third heaven:** Joseph (Yusuf)
- **Fourth heaven:** Idris
- **Fifth heaven:** Aaron (Harun)
- **Sixth heaven:** Moses (Musa)
- **Seventh heaven:** Abraham (Ibrahim)

### Classical Understanding

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir:**
> "The seven heavens are layers, one above the other, and between each heaven is a distance of 500 years of travel."

**Tafsir al-Jalalayn:**
> "Seven heavens, one above the other, in layers."

**Tafsir al-Tabari:**
> "Allah created seven heavens, one above the other, and seven earths, one below the other."

### The Scientific Reality

**1. There are no layered heavens**
- Space is continuous, not layered
- No boundaries exist between regions of space
- The concept of "layers" of heaven doesn't correspond to any astronomical reality
- Ancient cosmology, not science

**2. What exists instead:**
- **Earth's atmosphere** has layers (troposphere, stratosphere, etc.) but these aren't "heavens"
- **Interplanetary space** - not divided into seven layers
- **Interstellar space** - no layered structure
- **Universe** - continuously expanding space-time

**3. The "lowest heaven" problem**
- Quran says stars are in the "lowest heaven" ([Quran 67:5](https://quran.com/67/5))
- Stars are at vastly different distances
- Some stars are millions of light-years away
- They can't all be in one "layer"

### Ancient Cosmological Influence

The seven heavens concept appears in:

**Babylonian cosmology:**
- Seven celestial spheres
- Gods associated with each sphere
- Layered dome structure over flat earth

**Jewish/Talmudic tradition:**
- Seven heavens (Shamayim)
- Different levels with different purposes
- Paradise in the highest heaven

**Zoroastrian influence:**
- Persian cosmology had multiple heavens
- Layered spiritual realms
- Similar numerical significance to seven

### The Seven Earths Problem

[Quran 65:12](https://quran.com/65/12) says there are also seven earths "like them" (the heavens).

**Problems:**
- There aren't seven earths
- Classical scholars struggled to explain this
- Some said seven layers of earth (mantle, crust, etc.) - but these aren't seven "earths"
- Some said seven continents - but the Quran says "like" the seven heavens, implying parallel structure

**Ibn Abbas** said: "Seven earths: In every earth there is a prophet like your prophet..."

This makes no sense astronomically or geologically.

### Modern Apologetic Responses

**Argument 1: "It refers to atmospheric layers"**

Response:
- The Quran says stars are in the lowest heaven
- Stars aren't in Earth's atmosphere
- Classical scholars never understood it this way
- The hadith describes prophets living in these heavens

**Argument 2: "It's metaphorical/spiritual realms"**

Response:
- Muhammad physically traveled through them (according to hadith)
- Stars are physically placed in the lowest one
- Classical scholars took it literally
- If metaphorical, what does it mean?

**Argument 3: "It refers to different regions of space"**

Response:
- Space isn't divided into seven distinct regions
- No astronomical evidence for this structure
- This is retrofitting modern terms onto ancient cosmology
- The Quran describes them as solid structures ("strong")

**Argument 4: "Seven means 'many' in Arabic"**

Response:
- The Quran is very specific about seven in multiple verses
- Classical scholars took the number literally
- The Night Journey hadith describes exactly seven distinct levels
- This excuse could apply to any number in the Quran

### Why Seven?

Seven was a significant number in ancient Near Eastern cultures:
- Seven days of the week
- Seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)
- Seven Babylonian gods
- Seven levels in ziggurats

The Quran reflects these cultural beliefs rather than astronomical reality.

### The Biblical Comparison

The Bible uses "heaven" or "heavens" but not in this structured way:

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
> — Psalm 19:1

Paul mentions "third heaven" once:

> "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven."
> — 2 Corinthians 12:2

This is clearly discussing a spiritual/mystical experience, not claiming physical layered structure as factual cosmology.

The Bible's language is poetic and phenomenological. The Quran presents seven heavens as physical, structural fact.

### Why This Matters

The seven heavens concept reveals:

1. **Ancient cosmology** - Reflects Babylonian/Persian/Arabian beliefs
2. **No scientific basis** - Space isn't divided into seven layers
3. **Borrowed concepts** - Not original Islamic revelation
4. **Impossible to defend** - No apologetic successfully explains this
5. **Pattern of error** - Another example of outdated cosmology in Quran

## Questions to Consider

1. Why does the Quran describe space using ancient Babylonian cosmology?
2. If the seven heavens are real, why has space exploration found no boundaries?
3. Can a book from the Creator of the universe misunderstand cosmic structure?
4. Why do modern Muslims need to reinterpret what classical scholars understood clearly?
5. How is this different from other ancient creation myths with multiple heavens?
