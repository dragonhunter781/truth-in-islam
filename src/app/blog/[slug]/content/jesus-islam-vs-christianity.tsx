## Jesus in Islam vs Christianity: Fundamental Differences

Islam claims to honor Jesus, but the Islamic Jesus is radically different from the biblical Jesus. These differences aren't minor - they concern the very nature of who Jesus is and why He came.

### The Core Differences

**1. Jesus' Divine Nature**

**Christianity:**
> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us."
> — John 1:1, 14

Jesus is fully God and fully man - the second person of the Trinity who became incarnate.

**Islam:**
> "They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary'... Indeed, the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah..."
> — [Quran 5:72, 4:171](https://quran.com/5/72)

Jesus is only a prophet, not divine. Calling him God is shirk (the unforgivable sin).

**2. The Crucifixion**

**Christianity:**
> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
> — John 3:16

Jesus died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day.

**Islam:**
> "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them..."
> — [Quran 4:157](https://quran.com/4/157)

Jesus was never crucified. Allah made someone else look like Jesus, and that person was crucified instead.

**3. Jesus' Mission**

**Christianity:**
Jesus came to die for sins and provide salvation through faith in Him.

> "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
> — Mark 10:45

**Islam:**
Jesus came only to preach submission to Allah and prophesy Muhammad's coming.

> "And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, 'O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.'"
> — [Quran 61:6](https://quran.com/61/6)

### Detailed Comparison Table

| Attribute | Christianity | Islam |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Nature** | God incarnate, fully divine and human | Created prophet, fully human only |
| **Death** | Crucified for sins, buried, resurrected | Never crucified, taken to heaven alive |
| **Purpose** | Die as sacrifice for sin | Preach Islam, prophesy Muhammad |
| **Titles** | Son of God, Lord, Savior, God | Prophet, Messenger, Word of Allah |
| **Return** | Returns to judge all people | Returns to establish Islam, break crosses, kill swine |
| **Current Location** | Seated at right hand of God | In heaven (not at God's right hand) |
| **Birth** | Virgin birth (agreed) | Virgin birth (agreed) |
| **Miracles** | Many, including raising the dead | Many, but "by Allah's permission" only |

### The Islamic Jesus' Second Coming

According to hadith, when Jesus returns he will:

> "The Prophet said: 'There is no prophet between me and him (Jesus). He will descend... He will break the cross, kill swine, and abolish jizya. Allah will cause all religions to vanish except Islam.'"
> — [Sahih Bukhari 3:43:656](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3448)

**This means Islamic Jesus will:**
- Destroy all Christian symbols (crosses)
- Kill pigs (important to Jewish and Christian diet freedom)
- Abolish jizya (because all will convert or be killed)
- Force Islam on everyone
- Marry and have children
- Die and be buried next to Muhammad

This is utterly contrary to the biblical Jesus.

### Why the Differences Matter

**1. Salvation**

If Christianity is true, salvation comes through Jesus' death and resurrection:
> "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people."
> — 1 Timothy 2:5-6

If Islam is true, Jesus' death never happened and salvation comes through works and submission to Allah.

**These cannot both be true.**

**2. The Nature of God**

Christianity: God is Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
Islam: This is the unforgivable sin of shirk

> "Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills."
> — [Quran 4:48](https://quran.com/4/48)

**3. The Gospel Message**

Christianity's gospel: Jesus died for your sins, rose again, believe in Him for salvation
Islam's gospel: Submit to Allah, follow Muhammad, perform good works

**These are incompatible gospels.**

### Who is Right?

**Historical Evidence Supports Christianity:**

1. **Multiple Early Sources** - Four gospels, Paul's letters, other NT writings all confirm Jesus' death and resurrection
2. **Enemy Attestation** - Even hostile sources (Tacitus, Josephus) confirm Jesus was crucified
3. **Martyrdom** - Disciples died for their testimony of seeing the risen Jesus
4. **Empty Tomb** - Even Jesus' enemies didn't produce His body
5. **Rapid Spread** - Christianity exploded because of resurrection claims

**Islam's Claims:**

1. **600 years later** - Muhammad's claims about Jesus came centuries after the events
2. **No evidence** - No historical evidence anyone else was crucified instead of Jesus
3. **Substitution theory** - Never mentioned in any historical source until Quran
4. **Contradicts eyewitnesses** - Disciples testified they saw Jesus die and rise

### Classical Islamic Explanations

**Who was crucified instead?**

Islamic scholars disagree:
- **Judas Iscariot** (made to look like Jesus)
- **Simon of Cyrene** (who carried Jesus' cross)
- **One of the disciples** (volunteered to die in Jesus' place)
- **A random person** (Allah made him look like Jesus)

The Quran doesn't say. This crucial detail is left unexplained.

**Why the deception?**

If Allah made someone look like Jesus and allowed him to be crucified:
- Allah deceived billions of Christians for 600 years
- An innocent person died a horrible death for no reason
- Christianity was founded on a lie that Allah orchestrated
- God is the author of confusion, not truth

### The Quran's Internal Contradictions

The Quran calls Jesus:
- **Al-Masih** (المسيح) - The Messiah ([Quran 3:45](https://quran.com/3/45))
- **Kalimatullah** (كلمة الله) - Word of Allah ([Quran 4:171](https://quran.com/4/171))
- **Ruhullah** (روح الله) - Spirit from Allah ([Quran 4:171](https://quran.com/4/171))

But denies He is divine. How can Jesus be God's Word and Spirit, yet not divine?

The Quran acknowledges Jesus performed miracles no other prophet did:
- **Created life** - Made birds from clay ([Quran 3:49](https://quran.com/3/49))
- **Raised the dead** - Brought people back to life ([Quran 3:49](https://quran.com/3/49))
- **Virgin birth** - Born without a father ([Quran 3:47](https://quran.com/3/47))

Yet insists He's just a prophet like others.

### What Early Christians Believed

From the earliest records, Christians proclaimed:

> "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time..."
> — 1 Corinthians 15:3-6 (written ~55 AD, within 25 years of Jesus)

There was no confusion. From the beginning, Christians knew:
- Jesus died
- Jesus was buried
- Jesus rose again
- Many witnesses saw Him alive

### Why Muslims Must Reject the Biblical Jesus

If the biblical Jesus is true:
- Muhammad's revelation contradicts eyewitness testimony
- The Quran contains major historical errors
- Islam's gospel is false
- Billions of Muslims face judgment without a savior

This is why Islamic apologetics works so hard to discredit the Bible and present a different Jesus.

### The Heart of the Issue

Jesus asked His disciples:

> "Who do you say I am?"
> — Matthew 16:15

Peter answered:

> "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
> — Matthew 16:16

Jesus responded:

> "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
> — Matthew 16:17

The Islamic Jesus cannot save anyone because he's not divine, didn't die for sins, and didn't rise from the dead.

The biblical Jesus is:
- God in flesh
- Savior of the world
- Risen from the dead
- The only way to the Father

> "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"
> — John 14:6

## Questions to Consider

1. Why would Allah wait 600 years to correct the "misunderstanding" about Jesus?
2. If Jesus wasn't crucified, why do all historical sources say He was?
3. Can a prophet who never died for sins provide salvation?
4. Why does the Quran give Jesus unique titles (Word of Allah, Spirit from Allah) yet deny His divinity?
5. Which account is more historically reliable: eyewitness testimony or claims made 600 years later?
