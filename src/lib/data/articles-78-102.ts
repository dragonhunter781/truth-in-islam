<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Satanic Verses incident (also known as the <em>gharaniq</em> incident) represents one of the most controversial episodes in early Islamic history. According to early Islamic sources, Muhammad once recited verses acknowledging three pagan Arabian goddesses as legitimate intercessors, only to later claim these verses came from Satan rather than Allah.</p>

<h2>The Historical Account</h2>
<p>Early Islamic historians and commentators, including Ibn Ishaq, al-Tabari, and Ibn Sa'd, record this incident. According to these sources, Muhammad was seeking reconciliation with the Quraysh tribe and their polytheistic practices.</p>

<p>While reciting Surah 53 (An-Najm), Muhammad spoke favorably of three pagan goddesses worshipped by the Meccans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="arabic" style="font-size: 1.5em; direction: rtl; text-align: right;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ</p>
<p><strong>Transliteration:</strong> Afara'aytumu al-Lāta wal-'Uzzā, wa Manāta ath-thālithata al-ukhrā</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> "Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza, and Manat, the third one?" - <a href="https://quran.com/53/19-20" target="_blank">Quran 53:19-20</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the historical accounts, Muhammad then added the following verses (which are not in the Quran today):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"These are the high-flying cranes (gharaniq); verily their intercession is accepted with approval."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Pagan Response</h2>
<p>The pagans of Mecca were delighted by this apparent approval of their deities. According to al-Tabari's history, both Muslims and pagans prostrated together when Muhammad finished the recitation, believing reconciliation had been achieved.</p>

<h2>The Retraction</h2>
<p>Later, Muhammad claimed that Satan had inserted these verses, and Allah revealed replacement verses that condemned the goddesses instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="arabic" style="font-size: 1.5em; direction: rtl; text-align: right;">إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم</p>
<p><strong>Transliteration:</strong> In hiya illā asmā'un sammaytumūhā antum wa ābā'ukum</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> "They are not but [mere] names you have named them - you and your forefathers" - <a href="https://quran.com/53/23" target="_blank">Quran 53:23</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Quranic Explanation</h2>
<p>The Quran itself addresses this incident in Surah 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="arabic" style="font-size: 1.5em; direction: rtl; text-align: right;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ وَلَا نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا إِذَا تَمَنَّىٰ أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي أُمْنِيَّتِهِ</p>
<p><strong>Transliteration:</strong> Wa mā arsalnā min qablika min rasūlin wa lā nabiyyin illā idhā tamannā alqā ash-shayṭānu fī umniyyatih</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> "And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]" - <a href="https://quran.com/22/52" target="_blank">Quran 22:52</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Historical Sources</h2>
<p>The incident is recorded in numerous early Islamic sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Tabari's History</strong> (Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk) - One of the most authoritative early Islamic historians</li>
<li><strong>Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah</strong> - The earliest biography of Muhammad</li>
<li><strong>Ibn Sa'd's Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir</strong> - Early biographical dictionary</li>
<li><strong>Al-Waqidi's Kitab al-Maghazi</strong> - Early Islamic military history</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modern Islamic Apologetics</h2>
<p>Contemporary Muslim scholars often dismiss this incident as fabricated, arguing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hadith chains are weak or broken</li>
<li>It contradicts the doctrine of prophetic infallibility</li>
<li>Western orientalists have exaggerated its significance</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the widespread reporting in early Islamic sources and the fact that Quran 22:52 seems to address it directly make complete dismissal difficult.</p>

<h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
<p>Several aspects make this incident historically significant:</p>

<h3>1. Early Source Documentation</h3>
<p>The incident appears in multiple independent early Islamic sources, suggesting it was widely known in the early Muslim community.</p>

<h3>2. The Criterion of Embarrassment</h3>
<p>This historical principle suggests that embarrassing details about a religion's founder are more likely to be true, as followers would not invent stories that make their prophet look fallible.</p>

<h3>3. Quranic Evidence</h3>
<p>The existence of Quran 22:52, which specifically addresses Satan inserting verses into prophetic recitation, suggests something required explanation.</p>

<h3>4. The Goddesses</h3>
<p>The three goddesses mentioned were real deities worshipped in pre-Islamic Arabia:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Al-Lat</strong> - A goddess worshipped in Taif</li>
<li><strong>Al-Uzza</strong> - Associated with Venus, worshipped near Mecca</li>
<li><strong>Manat</strong> - A goddess of fate and destiny</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implications for Islamic Theology</h2>
<p>This incident raises important theological questions:</p>

<h3>Can Prophetic Revelation Be Corrupted?</h3>
<p>If Satan could insert verses into Muhammad's recitation, how can Muslims be certain other verses weren't similarly corrupted?</p>

<h3>The Doctrine of Abrogation</h3>
<p>This incident is sometimes cited as evidence for the concept of naskh (abrogation), where later revelations replace earlier ones. See our article on <a href="/blog/abrogation-peaceful-verses">The Doctrine of Abrogation</a>.</p>

<h3>Prophetic Infallibility</h3>
<p>The incident challenges the Islamic doctrine of prophetic infallibility ('isma), which holds that prophets are protected from major sins and errors in conveying revelation.</p>

<h2>Biblical Comparison</h2>
<p>The Bible presents different tests for true prophecy. In Deuteronomy 18:20-22, God warns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death. You may say to yourselves, 'How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?' If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare this with the biblical account of false prophets in 1 Kings 22, where false prophets speak lies, thinking they speak for God.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Satanic Verses incident, whether accepted or rejected by modern Muslims, appears in multiple early Islamic sources and presents significant theological challenges. The existence of Quran 22:52 suggests that some incident involving Satanic interference in revelation required explanation.</p>

<p>For those examining Islam critically, this episode raises fundamental questions about the reliability of Quranic revelation and the prophetic claims of Muhammad. If Satan could successfully insert verses that Muhammad initially believed were from Allah, what assurance exists that other portions weren't similarly compromised?</p>
